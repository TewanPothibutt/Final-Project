📌 Project Description
==========================
In this project, we explored an online payment fraud detection dataset to identify suspicious transactions. We started with a deep dive into the data through exploratory analysis—looking for patterns and unusual behavior.

As part of the analysis, we applied Linear Regression on the transaction amount column over time (step) to identify potential abnormalities or spikes in transaction volume, which could signal fraudulent activity.

We then tested four machine learning models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each helped us understand how well we could predict fraud based on different features.

The Random Forest model performed best overall, giving us deeper insight into transaction behaviors and helping us build a more reliable fraud detection system.
